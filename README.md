# Portfolio Website: Terminal Based

This is a **terminal-style portfolio website** built with **Next.js** and **TailwindCSS**, inspired by the look and feel of a Linux terminal. Instead of a traditional portfolio with static pages, users can interact with the site using **commands** just like in a command-line interface.

## Features

  - Interactive **command-line interface** (type `help` to see available commands).
  - Built with **Next.js** for fast performance and **Server-Side Rendering (SSR)**.
  - **ASCII banner** greeting and system info (OS, Kernel, Host, etc.).
  - Commands to explore:
      - `aboutme` â†’ Learn more about me.
      - `projects` â†’ View my highlighted projects.
      - `experience` â†’ Check out my professional background.
      - `education` â†’ See my academic history.
      - `skills` â†’ My technical skills.
      - `social` â†’ Links to my GitHub, LinkedIn, and email.
      - `resume` â†’ Download my resume directly.
      - `clear` â†’ Clear the terminal screen.
  - Deployed and hosted on **Vercel**.
  - Minimal and lightweight design with a **blinking cursor effect** for real terminal vibes. ðŸš€

This portfolio not only showcases my **projects** and **skills** but also reflects my **creativity and love for Linux/terminal environments**.
